 <h1>Work In Progress Product Manager</h1>

 <h2>My Journey</h2>

 <h3> When we create stuff, we do it because we listen to the customer, get their inputs and also throw in what we would like to see, too. We cook up new products. You never really know if people will love them as much as you do says Steve Jobs </h3>
